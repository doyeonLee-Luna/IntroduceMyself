# 🌟 Self-Introduction Page with Friend Request Form 🌟

## 👋 Project Overview

Welcome to my **Self-Introduction Page**! This project is a simple HTML page hosted on Tomcat 10.1. Along with a brief self-introduction, I've added a **Friend Request Form** where users can submit their **name** and **reason for wanting to be friends**. When the form is submitted, the details are displayed in the **console**.

This project showcases a basic web application that integrates HTML for the user interface, Java for server-side processing, and **Tomcat 10.1** as the web server.
